# SPT ARCHIVE
- TARGET: 3.10.5 (released 2nd April 2024)
- EFT Client Version: 0.15.5.1 33420 (released 2nd November 2024)

Legacy releases for people who wish to play the last major version of SPT rather than latest. This is not officially supported or endorsed by the SPT team. This does *NOT* bypass anti-piracy measures. This is simply a way for you to install legacy versions of SPT, current version target is `3.10.5`. I will not provide ways to bypass piracy measures.

**This repo will only ever support ONE major version back from current SPT latest. Once `4.0.X` is out, `3.10.5` will no longer be available for install.**

Please join the [Legacy SPT discord](https://discord.gg/XXeSBuKnHP) for discussions around old versions of SPT. Please keep any and all discussions here rather than the official SPT discord out of respect of the wishes of SPT staff/developers who made this project possible in the first place. 

# Why trust this?

This is a safe means of installation, I am a [mod developer](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/user/32691-jehree/) as well as a moderator in the SPT community.

# Code of Conduct
- You are *NOT* to ask for support in the SPT discord while running this version of SPT.
  - Doing so can result in you losing your ability to particape in support channels.
- You are *NOT* to bother mod authors with issues with now outdated versions of their mods.
  - Even if it has not been updated to the current version of SPT.
- You are expected to be fully self sufficient and able to handle install directions provided below with no additional help provided.
- You are expected to find the versions of mods compatible with the version of SPT you have installed.
- You are on your own when sourcing mods. Some mods are developed purely for new versions and thus only exist for newer versions.
  - Do not bother mod authors about backporting mods in these cases.

# Prerequisites
- Make sure you own a copy of Escape From Tarkov (Edition does not matter).
- Make sure your live EFT is fully up to date and the play button is visible.
- Make sure you have played atleast 1 live or PVE raid and that everything works as expected.
